## :wave: Description: 
### 💭 Keep Your Peace of Mind
Serenity Coves is a mock online wellness platform dedicated to providing curated health-related news and insights. The website's design draws inspiration from leading platforms, built to reflect an understanding of modern user experience and best practices in front-end development.

### 🎯 Follows Modern Designs:
The objective of this repository was to build an application that showcases an understanding for wireframing, designing, and creating a platform similar to the websites seen and used today. 

### 🌐 Accessible and Open:
Serenity Coves was developed with the intention to learn and try new things. Should any aspect of this project be of interest, the repository is open for you to use.

### 💭 Developer Notes:
The original objective was to create a static landing-page anyway possible. Upon completion this repository has become a sandbox for practicing semantic HTML and modern CSS use.

### 🙏 Thank You!
Thanks so much for checking out Serenity Coves, like any project it's always a journey. Personally I'm happy with the end product and believe this design can perform for a health and wellness platform. Thank you always, happy coding!
